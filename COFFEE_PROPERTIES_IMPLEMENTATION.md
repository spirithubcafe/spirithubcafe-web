# Coffee Properties Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds specialized coffee properties to your e-commerce system where each property option has its own individual price instead of modifying the base product price. This makes it easier for customers to see exactly what they're paying for each coffee option.

## What's Been Added

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### New Fields in Products Table
- `variety`: String field for coffee variety (e.g., "Bourbon", "Typica", "Geisha")
- `notes`: String field for tasting notes and flavor descriptions
- `farm`: String field for farm name or owner information
- `altitude`: String field for altitude information (e.g., "1500-1800m")
- `processing_method`: String field for processing method (e.g., "Washed", "Natural", "Honey")

#### New Coffee Properties System
- `coffee_properties`: Array of CoffeeProperty objects with individual pricing
- Each coffee property can have multiple options, each with its own complete price set

### 2. Type Definitions

#### New Types Added (`src/types/index.ts`)
```typescript
// Coffee Property Option with Individual Pricing
interface CoffeePropertyOption {
  id: string
  value: string
  label: string
  label_ar: string
  price_omr: number      // Complete price, not modifier
  price_usd: number
  price_sar: number
  sale_price_omr?: number
  sale_price_usd?: number
  sale_price_sar?: number
  is_on_sale: boolean
  stock?: number
  sku?: string
  is_active: boolean
  sort_order: number
}

// Coffee Property Types
interface CoffeeProperty {
  id: string
  name: string
  name_ar: string
  type: 'roast_level' | 'process' | 'variety' | 'altitude' | 'notes' | 'farm'
  required: boolean
  multiple_selection: boolean
  options: CoffeePropertyOption[]
  is_active: boolean
  sort_order: number
}
```

### 3. New Components

#### CoffeePropertiesForm (`src/components/admin/CoffeePropertiesForm.tsx`)
- Admin interface for managing coffee properties
- Allows adding properties like Roast Level, Process, Variety, Altitude, Notes, Farm
- Each option has individual pricing in all currencies (OMR, USD, SAR)
- Supports sale pricing for individual options
- Arabic/English bilingual support

#### CoffeePropertySelector (`src/components/product/CoffeePropertySelector.tsx`)
- Customer-facing component for selecting coffee properties
- Shows individual prices for each option
- Validates required property selections
- Real-time price calculation
- Selection summary display

#### Utility Functions (`src/utils/coffeePropertyUtils.ts`)
- `calculateProductPricing()`: Calculates final price based on selected options
- `validateCoffeePropertySelection()`: Validates required property selections
- `encodeSelectedOptions()` / `decodeSelectedOptions()`: URL encoding for sharing

### 4. Updated Components

#### ProductForm (`src/components/admin/ProductForm.tsx`)
- Added new "Coffee Info" tab
- Basic coffee information fields (variety, notes, farm, altitude, processing_method)
- Integration with CoffeePropertiesForm for advanced properties
- Updated form state and save logic

### 5. Firestore Indexes
Updated `firestore.indexes.json` with new indexes for:
- Products by variety
- Products by farm
- Products by processing method

## Key Features

### Individual Pricing System
Unlike traditional product variants that add/subtract from a base price, this system:
- Each coffee property option has its own complete price
- When selected, the option price replaces the base product price entirely
- Makes pricing more transparent and easier to understand

### Bilingual Support
- All labels and descriptions support Arabic and English
- RTL support for Arabic text
- Language-specific validation messages

### Admin Management
- Easy-to-use interface for adding coffee properties
- Bulk price calculation across currencies
- Visual price comparison with sale prices
- Stock management per option

### Customer Experience
- Clear pricing display for each option
- Required property validation
- Real-time price updates
- Selection summary

## Usage Example

### Admin - Adding Coffee Properties
1. Go to Product Form â†’ Coffee Info tab
2. Fill basic coffee information (variety, notes, farm, etc.)
3. Add advanced coffee properties:
   - Create "Roast Level" property
   - Add options: "Light Roast" (5.000 OMR), "Medium Roast" (5.500 OMR), "Dark Roast" (5.200 OMR)
   - Each option has its own complete price, not an addition to base price

### Customer - Selecting Coffee Options
1. Customer views product page
2. Sees coffee properties section
3. Selects "Medium Roast" option
4. Price immediately updates to 5.500 OMR (not base price + modifier)
5. Can add to cart with selected properties

## Database Migration Notes

When implementing this system, you'll need to:

1. Add the new fields to your products collection in Firestore
2. Update existing products to include the new fields (initially empty)
3. Deploy the new Firestore indexes
4. Migrate any existing product variants to the new coffee properties system if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Database Changes**: Update your Firestore schema and indexes
2. **Test Components**: Verify the new components work in your environment
3. **UI/UX Review**: Ensure the new interface matches your design system
4. **Data Migration**: If you have existing products, migrate them to the new system
5. **Frontend Integration**: Integrate the CoffeePropertySelector into your product pages
6. **Checkout Integration**: Update cart and checkout to handle selected coffee properties

## Benefits

### For Customers
- Clear, transparent pricing
- Easy to understand what they're paying for
- Better coffee selection experience
- No confusion about price calculations

### For Business
- More flexible pricing strategies
- Better inventory management per coffee type

This implementation provides a robust foundation for selling coffee with individual property pricing while maintaining a great user experience for both customers and administrators.
